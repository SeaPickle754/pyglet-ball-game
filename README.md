# pyglet-ball-game
A simple game made in pyglet (who hoo, no pesky pygame!) where you are a player who kicks a ball a random distance. The program ends if you kick it off the screen. Made in python 3.8 

# running:

just run Main.py OR click execute.command. Can't get any easier than that!

# orgin:
This is product of a challenge I gave myself: make a game in pyglet in a week. 5 picture files max, they have to be PNG, must be playable.
Medium-hard, super fun!! It gave me a chance to learn pyglet, and I am feeling super good with it now!

# depencencys:
pyglet-1.5.8
python-3.8

# preveiw:
A little bit shaky, not sure if you want this to take up some of your precious little memory on your 2012 laptop? I get it. pre.png is a screenshot of what the game is.
Don't like it? Just run delete.command and watch as the directory gets wisked away from your system. :)

# notes:
- don't run setup.command. That's for python 2. All it does is just run get-pip.py
- that background you see is Geany, a super helpful editor that that supports almost every language including obselite ones like D and Latex.
